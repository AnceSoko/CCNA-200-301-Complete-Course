Then I used the question mark, it says \"distance metric\". The word \"metric\" might be a little confusing, because this isn't the metric that dynamic routing protocols use to select the best route to a destination, this is the **AD**, administrative distance. So, to make it a floating static route, we have to set AD higher than the route learned via R2. If we don't do that, the static route will be selected instead of the OSPF route to enter the route table, which is not what we want. We want the OSPF route to be used by default, and this static route to be a backup. OSPF have an AD of 110, so let's go with 111.  \n",
